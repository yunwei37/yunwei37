<h2 align="center">Hey there, I'm Yusheng Zheng (yunwei37/云微) 👋</h2>

I'm a curious developer/explorer/founder who finds joy in building and exploring. 

- **Happy to offer consulting services！**
- **Open to academic collaborations!**
- **Or just open source connections! Would be very happy if we could work together on eBPF or LLM!** 
- **interested in my projects? Want to chat about new ideas? Need some help? Feel free to connect me!**

Want to know more about me...?

- 🚀 **Curiosity:** I know nothing about the world and quite stupid(At least much stupider than AI!), but I’m endlessly fascinated by how things work and how they can be better.
- 🖥 **Interests:** I'm passionate about computer systems, programming languages, and large language models (LLMs). I’m excited to push the limits of what’s possible with tools like eBPF. The rise of LLMs is unstoppable. I’m interested in making their inference faster and deployment easier in current operating systems. I’m also exploring how LLMs could change the way we think about operating systems and software.
- 🌟 **Projects:** I’m the creator of the [eunomia-bpf](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf) organization, where I work on eBPF tools and runtimes. I believe that eBPF has the potential to be incredibly powerful, not just on Linux but across all systems. Can we make that a reality? I’m committed to exploring how.
- 📝 **Writing:** I regularly share my thoughts and learnings on my blogs at [eunomia.dev/blogs](https://eunomia.dev/blogs) and [www.yunwei37.com](https://www.yunwei37.com/). It’s where I discuss my latest projects and ideas, especially around how LLMs and eBPF can revolutionize our tech landscape.

I got my Bachelor's degree from Zhejiang University. I was awarded the "Open Source Innovation Pioneer Award (开源创新先锋奖)" at the [Open Source Operating System Annual Technical Conference 10th](https://os2atc.cn/award.html) for contributing to the open-source community. I also served as a mentor/organization admin in the [Open Source Promotion Plan (OSPP)](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/) in 2023, 2024, and in the [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) in 2024.
